         <p xml:lang="en"> This guide explains the process of transcribing documents in Transkribus.
            These transcripts can be used: As training data for a Handwritten Text Recognition
            (HTR+) model which is capable of automatically transcribing your documents. As the basis
            for a digital scholarly edition.
            
            There is a simple three-step process for transcribing a
            document in Transkribus: Step 1: Uploading Upload your documents to the Transkribus
            platform Step 2: Segmentation Run the automated segmentation tool to create baselines
            for your document. Step 3: Transcription Transcribe the text in the segmented lines.
            This form of simple transcription is sufficient for training HTR technology. Note: HTR
            can work on both handwritten and printed documents. The efficiency of a model will
            depend on the quality of the training material (your manual transcription), the quality
            of the images and on how neat or messy the writing is. There are also advanced
            transcription options for those working on scholarly editions. You can adjust the
            reading order of the text, use historical characters, add tags and metadata, expand
            abbreviations and more. </p>
         <p xml:lang="jp"><s>このガイドでは、Transkribusで文書を翻刻するプロセスを説明します。</s>
            <s>これらの翻刻は以下のように使用できます。</s>
            文書を自動的に翻刻するための、手書き文字認識（HTR+）モデルの学習データとして。
            デジタル学術出版物の基礎資料として。
            
            Transkribusで文書を翻刻するには、3つのステップがあります。
            ステップ1：アップロード　文書をTranskribusプラットフォームにアップロードします。
            ステップ2：セグメンテーション 自動セグメンテーションツールを実行して、文書のベースラインを作成します。
            ステップ3: 翻刻　セグメンテーションされた行のテキストを翻刻します。
            この形式の単純な翻刻は、HTR技術のトレーニングには十分です。
            注：HTRは、手書きの文書と印刷された文書の両方に対応できます。モデルの効率は、学習教材（あなたが手入力する翻刻）の質、画像の質、そして文字がきちんとしているか・乱れているかに左右されます。
            また、学術編集版を扱う人のための高度な翻刻オプションもあります。テキストの読み順の調整、歴史的な文字の使用、タグやメタデータの追加、略語の展開などが可能です。 </p>

            <p> In order to be able to run the necessary tools on your documents they need to reside
               on the Transkribus server. This means that you need to upload them to Transkribus.
               Note: All collections and documents in Transkribus are private. Only users authorised
               by you are able to see your documents. They are not made available to the public. To
               upload click on the “Import Documents” button in the Main menu. </p>

            <head>Upload documents to Transkribus</head>
            <lb/>
            <p> You have four options to upload documents: Upload single document from a local
               folder: This option allows you to upload documents up to 500 MB In order to choose
               this option choose “Upload Single Document” Please make that the files to be uploaded
               reside in an extra folder. When choosing the files for the upload you won’t be able
               to see the files in the folder. That is normal in this case. Just mark the folder and
               confirm with “OK”. Upload via FTP This is suitable if you want to upload several
               large documents You can upload image files, as well as PDF-documents with this option
               Please make sure the PDF-files are not inside a folder when using the FTP-upload
               Upload via URL of DFG Viewer METS This allows you to upload documents directly from
               repositories which support the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft – German Science
               Funds) Viewer Extract and upload images from PDF This option is suitable for images
               you want to upload which reside in a PDF-document. If those PDF-documents are of big
               size, please use the FTP-upload. Also, if you have JP2000 images in your PDFs it
               makes sense to go for the FTP-option. Add pages to an already existing document in
               Transkribus: Load the document, you would like to add pages to in Transkribus Open
               the document manager Select the document again by clicking on it’s name in the
               “Document Manager”-window Click on the green circle icon next to “Add new page(s)”
               Search and add the new pages via the directory Delete documents from your collection:
               Select the document in the collection overview within the “Server”-tab Click on the
               folder icon with the small red circle “Delete the selected documents from
               Transkribus”. The deleted document(s) will reside in the recycle bin (icon “contains
               deleted documents”) for two weeks. If you have deleted a document by mistake you can
               contact us (info@readcoop.eu) and we will be able to reactivate the document within
               these two weeks. After this, the document will be permanently deleted. </p>

            <head>Segmentation – Layout Analysis</head>
            <lb/>
            <p> Once you have uploaded your documents to Transkribus, you are ready to start
               segmentation. In order to transcribe your documents in Transkribus, they must be
               segmented into text regions, lines and baselines. For the HTR to work, the text and
               image need to be connected. All the segmented elements, such as printspace, text
               region, line region or baseline are stored in the PAGE file with their coordinates. </p>
            <div2 n="1">
               <head>Viewing profiles</head>
               <lb/>
               <p> Viewing profiles are available to help you with the tasks of segmentation and
                  transcription. You can select between viewing profiles for “Segmentation” and
                  “Transcription” by clicking the “Profiles” button in the Main menu. The
                  “Segmentation” profile means that baselines are displayed in red, making it easier
                  to spot any errors resulting from the automated segmentation process. The
                  “Transcription” profile means that the Text Editor field will be displayed,
                  allowing you to transcribe your document. Of course you can simply use the
                  “default” profile to perform either task. </p>

               <p> Select the “Segmentation” viewing profile from the Main menu. Select the “Tools”
                  tab on the left side of the screen and go to the “Layout Analysis” section. Under
                  “Method:” select “CITlab Advanced” (already preselected). Select if you would like
                  to run the layout analysis only for the current page, for distinct pages, or for
                  the whole document. Make sure “Find Text Regions” is selected. Click the “Run”
                  button. If you would like to draw the text regions by hand and then search for the
                  baselines in these regions, untick the “Find Text Regions”-option before starting
                  the layout analysis. How to draw text regions is explained further down in the
                  text. </p>

               <lb/>
               <p> Note: if you are training a HTR model, the position of text regions does not need
                  to be completely exact and the reading order of the text is not relevant. If you
                  are working on a scholarly edition where a higher degree of accuracy is required,
                  it is possible to manually correct the text as in the examples below. All tools
                  for corrections on the layout analysis can be found in the “Canvas”-menu left of
                  the image. You can check their functionality by hovering over the icon. </p>

                  <lb/>
                  <p> In the example above the first line had been missed by the program. If you
                     would like to add it to the existing text region: Click inside the region so
                     that it is highlighted. Drag the border of the text region as needed. </p>

                  <lb/>
                  <p> If you need to split one region into two, you can do this with buttons in the
                     Canvas menu. As shown in Figure 6, the “H-button” splits a text region
                     horizontally. The “V” button splits a text region vertically. The “L-button”
                     allows you to split a text region with customisable line. </p>

                  <head>Remove a region which is not needed</head>
                  <lb/>
                  <p> In the example above two regions are overlapping, so one can be deleted. Click
                     on the text region you wish to delete, and click the red “Remove a shape”
                     button. </p>

               <div3 n="4">
                  <head>Merge two regions</head>
                  <lb/>
                  <p> Sometimes the program creates two text regions where only one is needed. In
                     this case you can easily merge the two together. Hold down the “CTRL” button on
                     your keyboard and click on both text regions. Click the “Merges the selected
                     shapes” button in the Canvas menu. </p>

                  <lb/>
                  <p> Of course it is also possible to correct the baselines in your document. As
                     with the text regions, click on a baseline and you can drag the parts of the
                     line, split a line into two or merge two lines together. You can also delete a
                     baseline and draw a new one from scratch. Click the “+BL” button in the Canvas
                     menu. Click once to start drawing your baseline and double-click to finish your
                     line. Note: Baselines are most important for HTR; line regions do not need to
                     be corrected. </p>

            <p> Select the “Transcription” viewing profile from the Main menu. You will see the Text
               Editor field below the image: For each line/baseline in the image you will find a
               corresponding line in the Text Editor. The image and the text are connected in this
               way. Transcribe the text according to the language of your source document. Use the
               characters of your keyboard. You can have more than one person working on a document
               but they should not work on the same page simultaneously. You can let other
               Transkribus users see your documents by clicking the “User Manager” button in the

            <p> If you wish to train a HTR model to recognise your documents, this simple
               transcription is sufficient. We recommend that you start the trainig process with
               between 5,000 and 15,000 words (around 25-75 pages) of transcribed material. If you
               are working with printed rather than handwritten text, a smaller amount of training
               data is usually required. Also using a base model can reduce the required training
               material. As base model you can use one of the publicly available models in
               Transkribus (please make sure the writing is at least similar to the one in your
               documents [e.g. of a similar date, the same language and/or style]) or one of your
               previously trained models – provided it is good enough to serve as a base model. </p>

               <head>Reading order</head>
               <lb/>
               <p> Once a document has been segmented into text regions, lines and baselines, you
                  may need to think about the reading order of the text (this is not relevant if the
                  transcription should only serve as training material). Many handwritten documents
                  include corrections and additions added by the author, or someone else. In a
                  scholarly edition you want to keep the reading order and maybe also express the
                  fact that this text was an addition. For this purpose all segmentation elements
                  can be ordered according to a user-defined order. The default reading order
                  follows the topology of the text or line regions. All shapes are ordered according
                  to the coordinates of the top left corner of a text or line region. This
                  mechanical reading order can be changed: Click on the “Item visibility” button in
                  the Main menu, and you can then choose to show the reading order of text regions,
                  lines, baselines (or words). Once you choose to show the reading order of text
                  regions or lines, numbers will be displayed on the image of your document. By
                  clicking on one of the numbers marking the reading order, it is possible to type
                  in a new number and change the reading order accordingly. The same can be done by
                  moving the segmentation elements in the “Layout” tab. In cases where the reading
                  order of a page is completely incorrect, it is possible to reorder the text Make
                  the line reading order visible as described above Click on the “Layout” tab on the
                  left side of the screen Select the page or text region that you wish to reorder
                  Click the “R” button The reading order will be rearranged according to the
                  coordinates of the top left corner of a text or line region. After that, the lines
                  should be in right order. There can be issues with the reading order of newspaper
                  columns and similar documents. E.g. the programme assigns a reading order based on
                  the horizontal layout of lines on a page, rather than putting the lines in order
                  by column. To fix this issue, use the “V” button in the Canvas menu to split the
                  text region on the page into separate regions for each column. Once there is a
                  separate text region for each column, the reading order should automatically
                  update and be correct. </p>

               <head>Reading order: Interline additions</head>
               <lb/>
               <p> Interline additions are a frequent way in which text is added to a document. In
                  order to generate the correct reading order, the following steps need to be
                  performed manually: Click the “Item visibility” button in the Main menu Select
                  “Show lines reading order” Select the baseline below the addition (if the addition
                  is above the line). Split the line region with the “V” button in the Canvas menu
                  exactly where the addition should be logically placed Edit the reading order so
                  that it is correct. Click on the number associated with each line region and then
                  type the correct one. </p>

            <div2 n="3">
               <head>Reading order: Additions as extra notes</head>
               <lb/>
               <p> Additions which appear as extra notes (e.g. at the margins of a page) should be
                  handled in a similar way to interline additions. Note: Often such extra notes (or
                  marginalia) are not part of the reading order but are “comments” and as such are
                  on a different level to the primary reading order. It will therefore be sufficient
                  to mark them as “marginalia” in the Metadata tab. Instructions on marking-up text
                  can be found in the How to enrich transcribed documents with mark-up guide. But if
                  the extra note is really an addition to the running text and needs to be added in
                  the reading order then it can be done in the following ways: Option 1: The text
                  region can be expanded so that all baselines of the addition are also part of the
                  respective text region. Note: You can use either rather large text regions, or you
                  may use polygonal text regions. For this purpose select the “Add point to selected
                  shape” button from the Canvas menu. Following the movement of your mouse pointer
                  you can add points to the original text region and expand the shape so that it
                  also includes the addition. Afterwards the additional lines/baselines can be
                  renumbered according to their correct reading order. Option 2: You can generate
                  just one large text region for the whole page and do the line/baseline
                  segmentation manually in the correct order. In this way you will get the correct
                  reading order right from the beginning. Note: this may be the best option if you
                  are dealing with a document which has a sophisticated layout with many additions,
                  notes and deletions. Option 3: You can connect the extra text region which
                  contains the addition to the line where the addition belongs. To do this, select
                  both text regions and then click the “Links two shapes” button in the “Structural”
                  tab, within the “Metadata” tab. Note: The linking will be part of the XML file but
                  is currently not supported in the export formats. </p>

               <p> A transcription which will serve as a basis for a scholarly edition should make
                  more data explicit to the user and offer more contextual data than a simple
                  transcription. In this case not only machine readability (i.e. training data for
                  the HTR engine) but also human readability of the text will play an important
                  role. You can add special characters and Unicode symbols using the “Virtual
                  keyboards” button in the Text Editor field. With the “Edit…” button it is possible
                  to add shortcuts for frequently used characters and to add new Unicode characters.
                  To create a shortcut, you just need to type it in the “Shortcut” column. To add
                  new Unicode characters, you use the green plus button. In the text editor you can
                  use “Backspace” to muve text one line up and “Ctrl” + “Return” to move text one
                  line down. </p>

               <head>Diacritics and ligatures</head>
               <lb/>
               <p> The correct transcription of diacritics and ligatures requires some expert
                  knowledge. There are two main options for handling the correct transcription of
                  these characters: Option 1: Slight normalisation according to dictionary The main
                  rule to be applied here is the following: As long as you can clearly see the base
                  character of a glyph and as long as the base character is also the one which is
                  used in the dictionary to express this glyph, keep to the base character. Example
                  1: LATIN SMALL LETTER Y will appear in many documents with an extra diacritical
                  sign, indicating the history of this character coming from ii or ij. Therefore you
                  find two dots or a something similar looking above the “y”. In simple transcripts
                  you will transcribe this as LATIN SMALL LETTER Y since the base character is
                  clearly visible. Example 2: LATIN SMALL LETTER S is expressed with two graphemes
                  in most European historical scripts. We find therefore a clear distinction between
                  LATIN SMALL LETTER S and LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S. But although there is a clear
                  distinction, a simple transcription would use LATIN SMALL LETTER S in both cases.
                  Option 2: Palaeographic Transcription Philologists or palaeographers are not only
                  interested in the correct transcription, but also in the historical appearance and
                  development of graphemes. Therefore it might also be interesting to transcribe the
                  above examples with full support of the Unicode character set or even by utilizing
                  the private area of Unicode. Note: Please take into account that this is an
                  important decision and will affect the usability of the text in many ways. If you
                  decide to go for a palaeographic transcription it will cause a lot more work than
                  with a slightly normalized transcription. Note: In printed texts (which can also
                  be transcribed in Transkribus) the transcription of ligatures may play a role.
                  Again the same rule can be applied: Though specific combinations of letters, such
                  as “ft” are expressed with a specific grapheme where two graphemes are matched
                  together, and though such ligatures can also be expressed with specific Unicode
                  letters, we recommend transcribing them according to the dictionary. </p>

               <head>Punctuation marks</head>
               <lb/>
               <p> Punctuation marks are transcribed in the same way as characters. Use the
                  appropriate character on your keyboard and do not normalize or add punctuation
                  marks. Typical punctuation marks are: modern characters such as dot, comma,
                  semicolon, colon: “.”, “,”, “;”:” historical characters such as virgule (slash),
                  or line fillers, etc. Note: Colons in historical texts are often used to mark
                  abbreviated words. These should be transcribed as a colon. In contrast to many
                  transcription rules where punctuation marks are added and omitted according to a
                  modern understanding we recommend to keep to the original punctuation marks. If
                  you want to add punctuation marks which do not appear in the original document you
                  may use the “supplied” tag in the “Tagging” tab, within the “Metadata” tab to
                  indicate that the punctuation mark was added by yourself. </p>

               historical transcriptions the following extensions are of interest: Latin Extended-B:
               http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0180.pdf Contains e.g.: Non-European and historic
               Latin Phonetic and historic letters Additions for Slovenian and Croatian etc. Latin
               Extended-C: http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2C60.pdf Contains e.g.: Orthographic
               Latin additions etc. Latin Extended-D: http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA720.pdf
               Contains e.g.: Medievalist additions Insular and Celtic letters Ancient Roman
               epigraphic letters etc. MUFI (Medieval Unicode Font Initiative) This initiative has
               collected and systematized about 1512 characters which are especially recommended for
               the transcription of medieval documents. Note: Some of them are still in the
               “private” section of Unicode, therefore not officially available.
